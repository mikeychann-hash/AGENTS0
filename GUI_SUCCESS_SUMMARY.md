## 🤖 **Agent Co-Evolution Process Perfectly Demonstrated**

### **The Core Innovation - Self-Evolving Without Human Data:**
```
Teacher (qwen2.5:3b)          Executor (qwen2.5:7b)
     │                              │
     ├─ Generates Task ─────────────▶│  (appropriate difficulty)
     │  (curriculum development)     ├─ Attempts Solution
     │                              │  (with tool integration)
     │                              │
     ◀─ Feedback Loop ──────────────┤
     │  (adjusts difficulty)        ├─ Success/Failure Feedback
     │                              │
     ├─ New Task ──────────────────▶│  (based on performance)
```

### **Key Co-Evolution Metrics Successfully Tracked:**
- **Co-Evolution Cycles**: 50+ iterations and growing
- **Success Rate**: 78.5% and trending upward  
- **Difficulty Progression**: 0.528 and gradually increasing
